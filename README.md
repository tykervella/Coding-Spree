After entering the mySQL terminal enter the code "SOURCE db/schema.sql" to create the user_db. 

Then, in the normal terminal, run the code "npm i" into node to install the necessary dependencies.

## USAGE

This program runs a server on your local device and the webpage is meant to be viewed at localhost:3001/ in whichever browser you already use. 

At the root directory, the user will see all posts including their title, content, and the user and date posted. The user can click on a button to view the post.

However, at this point the user will be directed to log in or sign up to view any of the other pages. 

The user can enter their email and password to login or they can sign up by providing a username, email and password.

Once signed in the user is taken to their dash which will display their posts. They can delete their posts, edit them, or view them. Additionally, users can create a post at this page. 

Finally, when viewing a post, users can comment their opinions under it!
